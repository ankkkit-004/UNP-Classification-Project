A customer churn project is a strategic initiative undertaken by businesses to understand, predict, and mitigate customer churn, which refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship with a company. Leveraging data analytics, machine learning, and customer behavior analysis, businesses aim to identify patterns and indicators that precede churn events. These initiatives may include personalized incentives, improved customer support, or product enhancements to address the specific needs and concerns of at-risk customers. The ultimate goal of a customer churn project is to enhance customer loyalty, reduce attrition rates, and foster sustainable, long-term relationships with the customer base, thereby positively impacting the overall success and profitability of the business.
